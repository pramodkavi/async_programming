Callback Hell callbacks are nested within other callbacks, often several levels deep, creating hard-to-read, hard-to-maintain, and error-prone code. It usually occurs when multiple asynchronous operations depend on each other and need to execute sequentially.

How Callback Hell Happens
In JavaScript, asynchronous tasks such as fetching data, reading files, or handling timers require callbacks to handle their results. When one asynchronous task depends on the result of another, callbacks can get deeply nested.
Example:
Imagine you have to perform the following steps:
1.	Fetch user data from a database.
2.	Fetch the user's orders based on the user ID.
3.	Process the orders to calculate the total amount.
4.	Save the total amount to the database.
Using traditional callbacks, the code might look like this:
